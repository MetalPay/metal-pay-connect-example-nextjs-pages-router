# metal-pay-connect-example-nextjs-pages-router

## Since nextjs includes a server out of the box, we don't need to run a seperate backend server. This means there is no nead to run the [metal-pay-connect-nodejs-example](https://github.com/MetalPay/metal-pay-connect-nodejs-example).

## Project setup

Add your `API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` to your `.env` file. Refer to our `.env.example` or rename it, and update it if you don't have one.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```
